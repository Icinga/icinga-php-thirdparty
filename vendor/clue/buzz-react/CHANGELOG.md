# Changelog

## 2.9.0 (2020-07-03)

A **major feature release** adding a new options APIs and more consistent APIs
for sending streaming requests. Includes a major documentation overhaul and
deprecates a number of APIs.

*   Feature: Add new `request()` and `requestStreaming()` methods and
    deprecate `send()` method and `streaming` option.
    (#170 by @clue)

    ```php
    // old: deprecated
    $browser->withOptions(['streaming' => true])->get($url);
    $browser->send(new Request('OPTIONS', $url));

    // new
    $browser->requestStreaming('GET', $url);
    $browser->request('OPTIONS', $url);
    ```

*   Feature: Add dedicated methods to control options, deprecate `withOptions()`.
    (#172 by @clue)

    ```php
    // old: deprecated
    $browser->withOptions(['timeout' => 10]);
    $browser->withOptions(['followRedirects' => false]);
    $browser->withOptions(['obeySuccessCode' => false]);

    // new
    $browser->withTimeout(10);
    $browser->withFollowRedirects(false);
    $browser->withRejectErrorResponse(false);
    ```

*   Feature: Add `withResponseBuffer()` method to limit maximum response buffer size (defaults to 16 MiB).
    (#175 by @clue)

    ```php
    // new: download maximum of 100 MB
    $browser->withResponseBuffer(100 * 1000000)->get($url);
    ```

*   Feature: Improve `withBase()` method and deprecate `withoutBase()` method
    (#173 by @clue)

    ```php
    // old: deprecated
    $browser = $browser->withoutBase();

    // new
    $browser = $browser->withBase(null);
    ```

*   Deprecate `submit()` method, use `post()` instead.
    (#171 by @clue)

    ```php
    // old: deprecated
    $browser->submit($url, $data);

    // new
    $browser->post($url, ['Content-Type' => 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'], http_build_query($data));
    ```

*   Deprecate `UriInterface` for request methods, use URL strings instead
    (#174 by @clue)

*   Fix: Fix unneeded timeout timer when request body closes and sender already rejected.
    (#169 by @clue)

*   Improve documentation structure, add documentation for all API methods and
    handling concurrency.
    (#167 and #176 by @clue)

*   Improve test suite to use ReactPHP-based webserver instead of httpbin and
    add forward compatibility with PHPUnit 9.
    (#168 by @clue)

## 2.8.2 (2020-06-02)

*   Fix: HTTP `HEAD` requests should not expect a response body.
    (#166 by @clue)

## 2.8.1 (2020-05-19)

*   Fix: Fix cancellation of pending requests with promise followers.
    (#164 by @clue)

## 2.8.0 (2020-05-13)

*   Feature: Use HTTP/1.1 protocol version by default and add new `Browser::withProtocolVersion()`.
    (#162 by @clue)

    This is the preferred HTTP protocol version which also provides decent
    backwards-compatibility with legacy HTTP/1.0 servers. As such, there should
    rarely be a need to explicitly change this protocol version. You can revert
    to legacy HTTP/1.0 like this:

    ```php
    $browser->withProtocolVersion('1.0')->get($url)->then(â€¦);
    ```

*   Feature / Fix: Explicitly close connection after response body ends.
    (#161 by @clue)

    This improves support for servers ignoring the `Connection: close` request
    header that would otherwise keep the connection open and could eventually
    run into a timeout even though the transfer was completed.

*   Fixed small issue in code example.
    (#160 by @mmoreram)

*   Clean up test suite and add `.gitattributes` to exclude dev files from exports.
    (#163 by @SimonFrings)

## 2.7.0 (2020-02-26)

*   Feature: Add backpressure support and support throttling for streaming outgoing chunked request body.
    (#148 by @clue)

*   Feature: Start sending outgoing request even when streaming body doesn't emit any data yet.
    (#150 by @clue)

*   Feature: Only start request timeout timer after streaming request body has been sent (exclude upload time).
    (#151 and #152 by @clue)

*   Feature: Reject request when streaming request body emits error or closes unexpectedly.
    (#153 by @clue)

*   Improve download benchmarking script and add new upload benchmark.
    (#149 by @clue)

## 2.6.1 (2020-01-14)

*   Improve test suite by testing against PHP 7.4 and simplify test setup and test matrix
    and fix testing redirected request when following relative redirect.
    (#145 and #147 by @clue)

*   Add support / sponsorship info and fix documentation typo.
    (#144 by @clue and #133 by @eislambey)

## 2.6.0 (2019-04-03)

*   Feature / Fix: Add `Content-Length: 0` request header for empty `POST` request etc.
    (#120 by @clue)

*   Fix: Only try to follow redirects if `Location` response header is present.
    (#130 by @clue)

*   Documentation and example for SSH proxy (SSH tunnel) and update SOCKS proxy example.
    (#116, #119 and #121 by @clue)

*   Improve test suite and also run tests on PHP 7.3.
    (#122 by @samnela)

## 2.5.0 (2018-10-24)

*   Feature: Add HTTP timeout option.
    (#114 by @Rakdar and @clue)

    This now respects PHP's `default_socket_timeout` setting (default 60s) as a
    timeout for sending the outgoing HTTP request and waiting for a successful
    response and will otherwise cancel the pending request and reject its value
    with an Exception. You can now use the [`timeout` option](#withoptions) to
    pass a custom timeout value in seconds like this:

    ```php
    $browser = $browser->withOptions(array(
        'timeout' => 10.0
    ));

    $browser->get($uri)->then(function (ResponseInterface $response) {
        // response received within 10 seconds maximum
        var_dump($response->getHeaders());
    });
    ```

    Similarly, you can use a negative timeout value to not apply a timeout at
    all or use a `null` value to restore the default handling.

*   Improve documentation for `withOptions()` and
    add documentation and example for HTTP CONNECT proxy.
    (#111 and #115 by @clue)

*   Refactor `Browser` to reuse single `Transaction` instance internally
    which now accepts sending individual requests and their options.
    (#113 by @clue)

## 2.4.0 (2018-10-02)

*   Feature / Fix: Support cancellation forwarding and cancelling redirected requests.
    (#110 by @clue)

*   Feature / Fix: Remove `Authorization` request header for redirected cross-origin requests
    and add documentation for HTTP redirects.
    (#108 by @clue)

*   Improve API documentation and add documentation for HTTP authentication and `Authorization` header.
    (#104 and #109 by @clue)

*   Update project homepage.
    (#100 by @clue)

## 2.3.0 (2018-02-09)

*   Feature / Fix: Pass custom request headers when following redirects
    (#91 by @seregazhuk and #96 by @clue)

*   Support legacy PHP 5.3 through PHP 7.2 and HHVM
    (#95 by @clue)

*   Improve documentation
    (#87 by @holtkamp and #93 by @seregazhuk)

*   Improve test suite by adding forward compatibility with PHPUnit 5, PHPUnit 6
    and PHPUnit 7 and explicitly test HTTP/1.1 protocol version.
    (#86 by @carusogabriel and #94 and #97 by @clue)

## 2.2.0 (2017-10-24)

*   Feature: Forward compatibility with freshly released react/promise-stream v1.0
    (#85 by @WyriHaximus)

## 2.1.0 (2017-09-17)

*   Feature: Update minimum required Socket dependency version in order to
    support Unix Domain Sockets (UDS) again,
    support hosts file on all platforms and
    work around sending secure HTTPS requests with PHP < 7.1.4
    (#84 by @clue)

## 2.0.0 (2017-09-16)

A major compatibility release to update this component to support all latest
ReactPHP components!

This update involves a minor BC break due to dropped support for legacy
versions. We've tried hard to avoid BC breaks where possible and minimize impact
otherwise. We expect that most consumers of this package will actually not be
affected by any BC breaks, see below for more details.

*   BC break: Remove deprecated API and mark Sender as @internal only,
    remove all references to legacy SocketClient component and
    remove support for Unix domain sockets (UDS) for now
    (#77, #78, #81 and #83 by @clue)

    >   All of this affects the `Sender` only, which was previously marked as
        "advanced usage" and is now marked `@internal` only. If you've not
        used this class before, then this BC break will not affect you.
        If you've previously used this class, then it's recommended to first
        update to the intermediary v1.4.0 release, which allows you to use a
        standard `ConnectorInterface` instead of the `Sender` and then update
        to this version without causing a BC break.
        If you've previously used Unix domain sockets (UDS), then you're
        recommended to wait for the next version.

*   Feature / BC break: Forward compatibility with future Stream v1.0 and strict stream semantics
    (#79 by @clue)

    >   This component now follows strict stream semantics. This is marked as a
        BC break because this removes undocumented and untested excessive event
        arguments. If you've relied on proper stream semantics as documented
        before, then this BC break will not affect you.

*   Feature: Forward compatibility with future Socket and EventLoop components
    (#80 by @clue)

## 1.4.0 (2017-09-15)

*   Feature: `Browser` accepts `ConnectorInterface` and deprecate legacy `Sender`
    (#76 by @clue)

    If you need custom connector settings (DNS resolution, TLS parameters, timeouts,
    proxy servers etc.), you can explicitly pass a custom instance of the
    [`ConnectorInterface`](https://github.com/reactphp/socket#connectorinterface):

    ```php
    $connector = new \React\Socket\Connector($loop, array(
        'dns' => '127.0.0.1',
        'tcp' => array(
            'bindto' => '192.168.10.1:0'
        ),
        'tls' => array(
            'verify_peer' => false,
            'verify_peer_name' => false
        )
    ));

    $browser = new Browser($loop, $connector);
    ```

## 1.3.0 (2017-09-08)

*   Feature: Support request cancellation
    (#75 by @clue)

    ```php
    $promise = $browser->get($url);

    $loop->addTimer(2.0, function () use ($promise) {
        $promise->cancel();
    });
    ```

*   Feature: Update react/http-client to v0.5,
    support react/stream v0.6 and react/socket-client v0.7 and drop legacy PHP 5.3 support
    (#74 by @clue)

## 1.2.0 (2017-09-05)

* Feature: Forward compatibility with react/http-client v0.5
  (#72 and #73 by @clue)

  Older HttpClient versions are still supported, but the new version is now
  preferred. Advanced usage with custom connectors now recommends setting up
  the `React\HttpClient\Client` instance explicitly.

  Accordingly, the `Sender::createFromLoopDns()` and
  `Sender::createFromLoopConnectors()` have been marked as deprecated and
  will be removed in future versions.

## 1.1.1 (2017-09-05)

* Restructure examples to ease getting started and
  fix online tests and add option to exclude tests against httpbin.org
  (#67 and #71 by @clue)

* Improve test suite by fixing HHVM build for now again and ignore future HHVM build errors and
  lock Travis distro so new defaults will not break the build
  (#68 and #70 by @clue)

## 1.1.0 (2016-10-21)

* Feature: Obey explicitly set HTTP protocol version for outgoing requests
  (#58, #59 by @WyriHaximus, @clue)

  ```php
  $request = new Request('GET', $url);
  $request = $request->withProtocolVersion(1.1);
  
  $browser->send($request)->then(â€¦);
  ```

## 1.0.1 (2016-08-12)

* Fix: Explicitly define all minimum required package versions
  (#57 by @clue)

## 1.0.0 (2016-08-09)

* First stable release, now following SemVer

* Improve documentation and usage examples

> Contains no other changes, so it's actually fully compatible with the v0.5.0 release.

## 0.5.0 (2016-04-02)

* Feature / BC break: Implement PSR-7 http-message interfaces
  (#54 by @clue)
  
  Replace custom `Message`, `Request`, `Response` and `Uri` classes with
  common PSR-7 interfaces:

  ```php
  // old
  $browser->get($uri)->then(function (Response $response) {
      echo 'Test: ' . $response->getHeader('X-Test');
      echo 'Body: ' . $response->getBody();
  });
  
  // new
  $browser->get($uri)->then(function (ResponseInterface $response) {
      if ($response->hasHeader('X-Test')) {
          echo 'Test: ' . $response->getHeaderLine('X-Test');
      }
      echo 'Body: ' . $response->getBody();
  });
  ```

* Feature: Add streaming API
  (#56 by @clue)

  ```php
  $browser = $browser->withOptions(array('streaming' => true));
  $browser->get($uri)->then(function (ResponseInterface $response) {
      $response->getBody()->on('data', function($chunk) {
          echo $chunk . PHP_EOL;
      });
  });
  ```

* Remove / BC break: Remove `Browser::resolve()` because it's now fully decoupled
  (#55 by @clue)

  If you need this feature, consider explicitly depending on rize/uri-template
  instead:

  ```bash
  $ composer require rize/uri-template
  ```

* Use clue/block-react and new Promise API in order to simplify tests
  (#53 by @clue)

## 0.4.2 (2016-03-25)

* Support advanced connection options with newest SocketClient (TLS/HTTPS and socket options)
  (#51 by @clue)

* First class support for PHP 5.3 through PHP 7 and HHVM
  (#52 by @clue)

## 0.4.1 (2015-09-05)

* Fix: Replace URI placeholders before applying base URI, in order to avoid
  duplicate slashes introduced due to URI placeholders.
  ([#48](https://github.com/clue/php-buzz-react/pull/48))

  ```php
  // now correctly returns "http://example.com/path"
  // instead of previous   "http://example.com//path"
  $browser = $browser->withBase('http://example.com/');
  echo $browser->resolve('{+path}', array('path' => '/path'));
  
  // now correctly returns "http://example.com/path?q=test"
  // instead of previous   "http://example.com/path/?q=test"
  $browser = $browser->withBase('http://example.com/path');
  echo $browser->resolve('{?q}', array('q' => 'test'));
  ```
